# Why `react-chartjs-2` has "2" in its name?

Initially, this library was [created in 2016](https://github.com/reactchartjs/react-chartjs-2/commit/d8cbcb7dc050d749771c6bb1347e22ec63bdddf9#diff-b335630551682c19a781afebcf4d07bf978fb1f8ac04c6bf87428ed5106870f5R3) as a wrapper for Chart.js v2.

Later, it was updated to support [Chart.js v3](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/v3-migration.html) â€” a huge yet backwards-incompatible release with new features and performance improvements. However, the name persisted.
